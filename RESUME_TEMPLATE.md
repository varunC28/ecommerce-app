## üéØ Interview Talking Points

### Technical Decisions
1. **Why React + Spring Boot?**
   - React for dynamic, responsive frontend
   - Spring Boot for robust, scalable backend
   - JWT for stateless authentication

2. **Why MongoDB Atlas?**
   - Cloud database for scalability
   - NoSQL for flexible data modeling
   - Free tier for cost-effective development

3. **Why Render?**
   - Free hosting for both frontend and backend
   - Easy deployment from GitHub
   - Good performance and reliability

### Challenges Solved
1. **Authentication System**: Implemented secure JWT-based auth with role management
2. **State Management**: Used React Context API for global state
3. **API Design**: Created RESTful APIs with proper error handling
4. **Deployment**: Successfully deployed full-stack app to cloud platform

### Learning Outcomes
1. **Full-Stack Development**: End-to-end application development
2. **Cloud Deployment**: Understanding of cloud platforms and databases
3. **API Design**: RESTful API development and documentation
4. **Security**: JWT authentication and role-based access control
